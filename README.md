# Art_and_Disability_Archive
This project focuses on the study of disability in visual art and culture using frameworks of contemporary disability theory. Research will focus on two primary areas: the study of artists with disabilities and the ethics of the representation of disability in art. Using a historical lens, we will research depictions of disability in art from antiquity to the present as well as historical attitudes toward and concepts of disability. The project will look broadly at images relating to both neurodivergence and physical disabilities with the goal of developing a reading list, a list of critical images, a student research symposium, as well as a web presence for further study. Lastly, we will pressure terms used to describe art by disabled persons, such as “naïve,” “outsider,” and “visionary,” and will create a standard of best practices with the goal of using art history to further access, autonomy, and ultimately acceptance of disability. 
This is a digital exhibit of the pieces that we analyzed.
